Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization
This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to optimize investment portfolios. The goal is to develop an intelligent trading agent capable of making informed investment decisions based on historical market data.

Overview
In the context of financial markets, portfolio optimization involves selecting the optimal mix of assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Traditional methods often rely on static models; however, this project leverages RL to adaptively learn and improve portfolio strategies over time.

Key Features
Dynamic Portfolio Management: Utilizing RL algorithms to dynamically adjust asset allocations based on market conditions.
Backtesting: Comprehensive backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the RL agent against historical data.
Performance Metrics: Metrics to assess the efficiency of the investment strategy, including Sharpe Ratio, drawdown, and total return.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
